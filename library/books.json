  "synopsis": "What do Christians believe they will experience after a virtuous life? What will an eternity in the hereafter be like? In this copiously illustrated, lively book, Colleen McDannell and Bernhard Lang describe and interpret the ways in which believers—from biblical authors to medieval mystics, from Jesus to present-day religious thinkers—have pictured Heaven, not just in doctrine but also in poetry, art, literature, and popular culture. In so doing, they shed new light on both the private and public dimensions of western culture. This second edition includes a substantial new preface relating the book to changing views of life after death in the new century.\\nAuthor Biography: Colleen McDannell is Sterling McMurrin Chair of Religious Studies and associate professor of history at the University of Utah. She is also the author of Material Christianity. Bernhard Lang is professor of religion at the University of Paderborn, Germany, and the author of Sacred Games: A History of Christian Worship. Both of these books are published by Yale University Press.\\n\\n\\n                        Combs through sources from the New Testament to modern day fundamentalists to examine the idea of paradise.\\n",

  "synopsis": "From the award-winning avatar of contemporary urban theater and author of such modern classics as \"Talk Radio\" and \"subUrbia\" comes this outrageous novel about five suburbanites whose lives intersect in one violent and life-altering night -- at the local mall.Mal, a thirtysomething speed freak, shoots his mother, torches his house, and heads to the local mall with a sack of weapons and a plan for more mayhem. Danny, a voyeuristic businessman with a fetish for young underwear models, is caught by mall security peeking into dressing rooms at JCPenney. Jeff, a teenager with existential troubles, drops acid and departs on a philosophical nightmare. Donna, a hungry, unsettled housewife, is on the lookout for a one-night stand. Michel, a Haitian immigrant and mall security guard, seeks salvation. All long for a kind of satisfaction, and this longing leads them to the modern plaza of possibility, the shopping mall, where their appetites converge in explosive ways.Satirical and provocative, Mall is an eye-opening look at suburban life and the idea of \"normalcy.\" In this, his first novel, Eric Bogosian delivers a dark, hilarious, and biting commentary on an American culture fraught with sex, drugs, violence, and congested thinking.<h3>Book Magazine</h3>In this incendiary first novel, a Columbine-style massacre at a suburban shopping mall throws disparate&#151;and desperate&#151;lives up for grabs, rearranging the pieces of society's puzzle in revelatory fashion. Through a series of short chapters that explode like cherry bombs, Bogosian sears the psyches of his characters, which include a speed freak turned guerrilla commando, a housewife of insatiable appetites, a successful businessman who is ashamed of his secrets and a drop-out stoner with a penchant for philosophical speculation. Bogosian remains the hot-button provocateur, showing the same mix of sociopathic empathy, moral urgency and lethal irony here that has distinguished his plays (<i>Talk Radio</i>, <i>subUrbia</i>) and solo performances. \"Mal had spent years doing nothing, taking up space,\" he writes. \"As far as he was concerned, that's what everyone else did as well. No one wanted to admit it. Like dumb dinosaurs caught in a pool of tar, everyone pretending that it was all OK, until it was too late.\" For all of the characters that he illuminates from within their darkest recesses, the voice and vision are unmistakably Bogosian's.<BR> &#151;Don McLeese",

  "year": 1999,
  "synopsis": "An exciting new work, richly illustrated, on the age-old images and stories about frightening men.\\nIn this provocative new work, Marina Warner goes beyond the terrain she covered in her widely praised <i>From the Beast to the Blonde</i>. She explores the darker, wilder realm where ogres and giants devour children, where bogeymen haunt the night and each of us must face our bugaboos. No Go the Bogeyman considers the enduring presence and popularity of figures of male terror, establishing their origins in mythology and their current relation to ideas about sexuality and power, youth and age.\\nSongs, stories, images, and films about frightening monsters have always been invented to allay the very terrors that our dreams of reason conjure up. Warner shows how these images and stories, while they may unfold along different lines--scaring, lulling, or making mock-always have the strategic, simultaneous purpose of both arousing and controlling the underlying fear. In a brilliant analysis of material long overlooked by cultural critics, historians, and even psychologists, Warner revises our understanding of storytelling in contemporary culture, of masculine identity, racial stereotyping, and the dangerous, unthinking ways we perpetuate the bogeyman.<br>\\n",

  "synopsis": "As one of ten kids in a blue-collar family in Edgewater, New Jersey, Barbara Corcoran didn't have many material advantages. She shared her bedroom with five sisters and shared her socks in a communal sock drawer. Yet she grew up to have plenty of self-confidence, because her mother had an amazing gift for nurturing the unique talents in each of her children. Barbara's mom didn't know much about business, but she understood how the world works, and how to make the most of what you've got.<br>\\n<br>\\n In the early 1970s, Barbara borrowed $1000 from her boyfriend to get her start in real estate. That led to the birth of The Corcoran Group, which today is New York's premier residential real estate brokerage, with over $1 billion in annual revenue. Her amazing rise to the top has become the stuff of legend and inspiration. <br>\\n<br>\\n Barbara — now nicknamed the Queen of New York Real Estate — credits her success to not just to hard work and determination, but to her mom's enormously valuable advice. Not just the standard maternal wisdom, but real gems such as, \"If the clubhouse is quiet, they're probably not making spaghetti.\" <br>\\n<br>\\n In <i>Use What You've Got</i>, Corcoran illustrates her mother's wisdom and insight with twenty-five \"how tos\" for getting ahead in business. Each lesson is brought to life with real business scenarios, an outrageous childhood adventure story, and tips garnered from Corcoran's years in the most competitive real estate market in the world. <br>\\n<br>\\n Her mother's winning advice includes: <br>\\n<br>\\n \"There's always room for one more.\"<br>\\n \"It's your game, make up your own rules.\"<br>\\n \"You've got to bully a bully.\" <br>\\n<br>\\n With a tell-it-like-it-is attitude, Corcoran offers her keys to success — from dressing the part and overcoming obstacles to the nuts and bolts of hiring, firing, motivating, marketing, and much, much more. \\nAuthor Biography: Barbara Corcoran is a self-made business baroness. Founder of the Corcoran Group, New York's premier real estate company, Corcoran is one of the most powerful brokers in the nation.",

  "synopsis": "Among those within the self-contained world of the Willow Glen nursing home are two extraordinary people. One is there to give care, the other to receive it. Yet together they form a band of love and trust that transcends their expectations and changes their lives. Violence shatters Willow Glen as a murderer roams the halls of the home, and the residents and staff must confront a truly terrifying evil and face their innermost fears, suspicions & darkest secrets...<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>Setting his first novel in the Midwestern community of New Warsaw, psychologist Peck ( The Road Less Traveled ) focuses on inmates of the Willow Glen nursing home. This small but fascinating world is soon disrupted by the murder of its most famous and charismatic resident, spastic quadriplegic Stephen Solaris, who taps messages with his knuckles on a letter board and is the only non-elderly resident. Ex-New Yorker Lt. Petri, a fresh recruit to the local police force, plunges into an investigation, armed with a fistful of preconceptions about nursing homes and seniors, and is saved from making a false arrest by the fortunate interference of residents Marion Grochowski and Georgia Bates. Petri admits his mistake and broadens his search, finally seeking help from Dr. Kolnietz, Willow Glen therapist. Peck's interest in the metaphysical is well placed in the nursing home setting, where death is an expected visitor. Yet the author's examination of virtue is more searching than his consideration of evil, and some characters experience unconvincing changes of heart. But that should not deter the reader from enjoying a generally intelligent look at human growth. (Sept.)",

  "synopsis": "<P>Narcotics officer Cal Moore's orders were to look into the city's latest drug killing. Instead, he ends up in a motel room with a fatal bullet wound to the head and a suicide note stuffed in his back pocket. Working the case, LAPD detective Harry Bosch is reminded of the primal police rule he learned long ago&#58; Don't look for the facts, but the glue that holds them together. Soon Harry's making some very dangerous connections, starting with a dead cop and leading to a bloody string of murders that wind from Hollywood Boulevard to the back alleys south of the border. Now this battle-scarred veteran will find himself in the center of a complex and deadly game-one in which he may be the next and likeliest victim.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>LAPD detective Hieronymous ``Harry'' Bosch, protagonist of the highly praised mystery The Black Echo , returns in a procedural thriller set in and around the drug-trafficking underworlds of inner-city Los Angeles and the wastelands of Mexico. When Bosch arrives at a sleazy hotel room where a fellow officer has committed suicide, he senses that something is awry. Noncommittal superior officers, a diffident widow and tales linking the dead man to a newly created street drug called ``black ice'' (heroin, crack and PCP rolled into one) send Bosch down a winding trail of forensic impossibilities, brutally violent drug traffickers and an ultimately shocking case of mistaken identity. Award-winning Connelly's second fictional effort is strong and sure. His pacing could be better--too often he conveys the same information twice--but his plot and characters more than make up for a slow start. This novel establishes him as a writer with a superior talent for storytelling. (June)",

All the kids on the North End of Boston dreamed of being hoodlums and mobsters - their heroes were the Brinks bandits and the wiseguys with their fancy suits and Cadillacs. But only Willie Fopiano, the smartest and the wildest, became an apprentice to the wiseguys and a trusted aide of Meyer Lansky. Crime was his life and The Godson is his incredible story. At the age of ten he was beating convicted killers at craps and winning their respect. When other kids were struggling with their homework, Willie Fopiano was running his own crew of master thieves and playing Monopoly with real money. By his early twenties he had survived the wrath of vicious cops, done time in prison, made friends with Albert DeSalvo - the man who confessed to being the Boston Strangler - and been dragged into the bloodiest gang war the country has ever seen. More than once he nearly became a victim himself in run-ins with a killing machine named Joe Barboza. Bank scores and jewelry heists, planned like commando raids, made Willie a young millionaire, and his glamorous life of crime took him to the glittering city splendor of mob citadels in Las Vegas and Miami Beach. Along the way, Willie met the mysterious men who ran the Pizza Connection heroine ring and learned the mob's darkest secrets. The Godson will reveal why the mob felt betrayed by Joseph Kennedy and why John F. Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe died. It is the ultimate account of the inner workings of the Boston Mob and Meyer Lansky, as told in his own words by the only surviving insider.",

These writings present a map of the landscape, a guide for people perplexed by the gap between contemporary political theories and practices. Here are essays about the peculiar goings-on on campuses, where \"rights\" - including a right to Chinese take-out food - multiply. Mr. Will is as pleased by the thirtieth anniversary of The Public Interest quarterly as he is appalled by the horrific new \"sport\" of \"extreme fighting,\" which raises questions about the limits of permissible commerce. Here are snapshots of something trivial, the 1996 presidential campaign, that illustrated something momentous, the marginalization of the presidency. Mr. Will examines the achievements and misadventures of judicial activism, the writing of national standards for the teaching of history, and the West's response to genocide in the Balkans. But as always in Mr. Will's writings, there is time for the pure fun of life in a nation blessed with ESPN and Corvettes.",

  "synopsis": "The remarkable best-seller -- a long-lost, 300-year-old book of wisdom on how to live successfully yet responsibly in a society governed by self-interest -- as acute as Machiavelli yet as humanistic and scrupulously moral as Marcus Aurelius. <h3>Library Journal</h3> Maurer retranslates a 17th-century Jesuit's aphorisms and reflections on the morality of success. This long-admired work sounds surprisingly relevant today. It also combines brevity and grace of expression with wise advice, which should appeal to those seeking ``how-to'' spirituality which is universal, practical, and applicable in business. Recommended for public libraries.",
